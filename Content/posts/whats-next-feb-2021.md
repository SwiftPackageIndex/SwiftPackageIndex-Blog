It’s been about seven months since we [launched the Swift Package Index](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/460#start) and we’ve been hard at work implementing a few major updates. Most significantly, [real-world package compatibility](https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/launching-language-and-platform-package-compatibility), [a comprehensive set of RSS feeds and Twitter updates](https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/keeping-up-to-date-with-swift-packages), and most recently [inline README files](https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/inline-readme-files).

But we’re far from done! 😅

So, in the spirit of letting you all know what we’re planning for this project next, we wanted to start a regular series of blog posts about the direction we’re heading with feature development. We’ll post every couple of months, giving a quick recap of what we’ve achieved along with where we’re heading next. It’s not a formal roadmap. It’s more a declaration of where our focus will be for the next couple of months.

## What’s next?

So without further ado, what are we focusing on next?

### Intermediate Search Page

Currently, search results are displayed inline on the home page, which makes it hard to integrate share package searches (there’s no URL for a search), or integrate with productivity tools like Alfred or Raycast, or even DuckDuckGo through their [bangs feature](https://duckduckgo.com/bang). We want to fix that.

### Package Collections

If you’ve been following the [package collection work](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0291-package-collections.md) in the SPM project, then it might have struck you that the Swift Package Index would be a great source of package collections, when they are added. We agree! We’ve been working hard on the behind-the-scenes work for this already, and want to have something publicly available as soon as it makes sense with feature becoming available in SPM.

### Design updates

The initial site design suited our initial feature set but has become a little overloaded as we added features. This work has already started, with a new package page layout rolling out last Friday. There’s more design work coming though, including work on making the home page more interesting. Those two lists are fine, but we can do much more!

### The Swift Package Index macOS App

We’ve always wanted to create a Swift Package Index Mac app of some kind. The app’s main purpose would be to allow you to easily try packages out in a Swift Playground (utilising the wonderful [Arena](https://swiftpackageindex.com/finestructure/Arena) tool). But it could be so much more. We want to define what this app will do, and then get something out that works towards that definition. We talked about the interesting story behind this feature [on John Sundell’s podcast last year](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/75/), if you’re interested! 

### And More…

This is not a comprehensive list of things we’ll do. This is a young project, and we want to keep development agile. If we have a great idea, it may go into the plan ahead of everything you read above!
