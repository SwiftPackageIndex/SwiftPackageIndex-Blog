title: Supporting Swift 5.9 Betas
description: How could we improve on adding support for a new Swift version after just one week of it being available? We could add support for Swift 5.9 one week after the release of the first beta version!
---

Back in April, we were [proud to announce that we supported Swift 5.8 within one week of the official release](https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/supporting-swift-58/), adding it to our compatibility matrix so you could know whether the package you were considering would work with the latest version of Swift.

How could we improve on adding support for a new Swift version after just one week of it being available? We could add support for Swift 5.9 one week after the release of the _first beta version_!

So, thatâ€™s the announcement! The Swift Package Index **now supports Swift 5.9** packages, including macros, the new syntax, and [everything else Swift 5.9 brings](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/258/whats-new-in-swift-5-9)!

**Note:** For the next few days, you may see question mark icons against the Swift 5.9 beta column in the matrix. Please bear with us while our systems process the build backlog.
